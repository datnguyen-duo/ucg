                Uncommon Capital Group was founded by Ben Harris to deliver
                premium investment access, due diligence, and service to a
                premier community of private investors. Ben began his career at
                Starwood Capital, one of the largest real estate private equity
                firms in the world, where he conducted investment analysis and
                reporting for the company’s sovereign wealth fund investors. Ben
                then joined Origin Investments as one of the first employees
                where he helped grow the firm into one of the nation’s
                preeminent direct-to-investor platforms with thousands of
                private investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uncommon Capital Group was born out of these experiences and the
                belief that family offices, RIAs, and high-net-worth individuals
                deserve an institutional experience during every step of the
                investment process. Harnessing more than a decade of industry
                expertise, we offer a distinguished combination of white glove
                service, comprehensive market insights, and a proven track
                record of success for investors.

              After historically playing second fiddle to multifamily, office,
              hotels and retail, industrial real estate is now considered a
              primary asset class. What is industrial real estate exactly? The
              term refers to properties used to develop, manufacture, or produce
              goods, as well as logistics properties that support the movement
              and storage of products. The once unpopular property type is now
              so high in demand that supply has not been able to keep up, and
              investors are taking advantage.
            </p>

          <div class="story_second_section">
            <h3>Why Now?</h3>
            <p>
              Tenant demand for industrial space has been fueled by the rise of
              e-commerce, a trend further accelerated by the pandemic. Ten years
              ago, e-commerce accounted for ~5% of total retail sales. Today,
              online sales account for ~20% of all retail sales (U.S. Department
              of Commerce Data, Nov 2021) and that figure continues to increase
              each year. In fact, 2021 saw a 45% increase in e-commerce sales
              while brick and mortar retail sales grew by only 17%. As society
              continues to adopt online shopping, e-commerce companies will need
              more and more industrial space.
            </p>

                /images/blog_1/image1.webp     1130w
              "

            />
            <p>
              How much more space is needed? CBRE research estimates that every
              $1 billion in incremental e-commerce sales generates 1.25 million
              square feet of new demand for warehouse space. Given the rapid
              growth of e-commerce, it makes sense that a year-over-year
              comparison of leasing volumes looks like this:
            </p>

              class="half-size"
            />
            <h3>Industrial Demand > Industrial Supply</h3>
            <p>
              Surely, tenant demand for industrial real estate must mean supply
              has kept up with the demand, right? Actually, no. In fact, there
              has been positive net absorption for more than 44 straight
              quarters. That means more space has been leased than delivered for
              more than 10 straight years! 
            </p>

            <p>
              Why? One of the primary reasons for limited supply is due to
              highly regulated zoning and land use provisions. Despite the high
              demand, strict local regulations have created a natural barrier to
              entry. Many municipalities across the country have limits on the
              location, quantity, and pace of new development. Essentially,
              NIMBY (Not In My Backyard) has protected the industrial real
              estate sector from overbuilding.

            <h3>Low Vacancy = High Rent Growth</h3>
            <p>
              Since demand continues to surpass supply, just how low are
              industrial vacancy rates? Simply put, the answer is – low.
              According to CBRE’s Q2 2021 Industrial & Logistics Figures report,
              the national vacancy rate is down to 4.0%, and the rates in
              primary industrial markets is even lower – Inland Empire 1.4%, Los
              Angeles 1.2%, Boston 2.5%, Central New Jersey 2.1%, and Chicago
              2.1%.
            </p>
            <p>
              These low vacancy rates have put upward pressure on rental rates
              since tenants are continuously competing for limited space
              availability. In fact, rents have experienced positive
              year-over-year growth for 40 straight quarters. In the past year
              alone (as of Q2 2021), national year-over-year rent growth for
              industrial real estate increased 9.8%, an acceleration from
              previous quarters.

            <h3>How do these metrics translate to profits?</h3>
            <p>
              Well, no one is profiting more than developers since the
              development spread (development yield minus stabilized cap rate)
              is wider than normal right now.
            </p>

            <p>
              What is a development yield? This figure measures the annual
              return a developer expects to earn once a project is leased
              (“stabilized”), and is calculated by dividing a project’s expected
              net operating income by the project’s cost. What is a stabilized
              cap rate? This figure is the yield a buyer could expect to earn if
              they buy a stabilized project for a given price. The spread
              between these two rates is the main way a developer earns profit
              when selling a project. The larger the spread, the more beneficial
              to the developer (seller). So what does the spread look like today
              for industrial real estate?
            </p>
            <p>
              Let’s first look at development yields. The denominator (cost) has
              increased dramatically. Limited land availability, supply chain
              issues, and labor shortages have caused the price of land,
              materials, and labor to all climb. Inflation is real.
            </p>
            <p>
              As we established earlier, the numerator (net operating income)
              has been increasing at record rates thanks to record rent growth.
              So much so, that even with rising costs, development yields are
              generally in line with the trailing 5-year average of ~6%.
            </p>
            <p>
              And how about cap rates? These are far lower than the trailing
              5-year average. Based on the chart below, in Q1 2016, buyers were
              willing to receive just over a 5% yield for a stabilized
              industrial project. Fast forward to Q3 2021 – buyers are now
              willing to receive just over a 3% yield. In other words, buyers of
              stabilized industrial real estate are now willing to pay much more
              for the same income stream, resulting in a seller’s market for
              industrial developers.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>

            <p>
              Thanks to the booming e-commerce industry, we are seeing record
              high rents and low vacancies with every passing quarter. This
              trend has made industrial real estate one of the most in-demand
              property types. So, that only leaves one question: what’s the best
              way to invest in the asset class today?
            </p>

            <p>
              Investors who want to earn current income should focus on
              investing in a stabilized project or fund. However, be aware that
              cap rates are at all-time lows, so stabilized investments don’t
              provide the same annual yield for the same level of risk that they
              used to generate just a few years ago.
            </p>

            <p>
              For investors willing to defer current income for a larger
              potential future return, an investment in a development project or
              fund could be the best way to approach industrial real estate.
              Tenant demand continues to significantly outpace new supply,
              resulting in a favorable environment for leasing a new development
              project. And once a development is leased, new buyers are paying
              record low cap rates for stabilized buildings, resulting in record
              high pricing for developers selling projects.

              For the past decade, the same real estate fund managers have been
              sucking up the majority of investor capital into their mega funds.
              In fact, only a quarter of total capital raised this year went to
              smaller managers (Preqin Global Real Estate Report, 2021).
            </p>
            <p>
              But why? Are larger funds better or are they simply more
              convenient to invest in? In 2017, Preqin, the premier database for
              private real estate, conducted a comprehensive study to help
              answer this question.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the report, smaller funds (less than $500 million)
              consistently outperform their larger counterparts. From 2005 to
              2014, small funds generated a median return of 10.9%, while
              mid-sized funds ($500 – 999 million) generated 9.1% and larger
              funds ($1 billion or more) earned 6.9%. This study proves that
              larger size is not necessarily correlated with larger profits, and
              investors should be taking a closer look.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="story_second_section">
            <h3>How do the top and bottom performers compare?</h3>
            <p>
              Smaller funds in the top quartile generated a median net IRR of
              15.8%, outperforming the 12.4% and 12.0% median net IRRs produced
              by mid-sized and large funds, respectively. No one year buoyed the
              overall median net returns either. Top quartile small funds
              outperformed top quartile larger funds in 8 of the 10 vintages
              examined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even the worst of the smaller funds outperformed the worst of the
              larger funds. Smaller funds in the bottom quartile earned a medium
              net IRR of 6.2%, beating the 2.8% return generated by both
              mid-sized and larger bottom quartile funds.
            </p>
            <h3>Do smaller funds mean more risk?</h3>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, yes. Smaller funds are more volatile than
              larger funds. While these funds typically demonstrate higher net
              IRRs than larger funds, the returns typically have a higher
              standard deviation around them.
            </p>
            <h3>Is the risk worth the reward?</h3>
            <p>
              According to Preqin data, the best risk/return profile is offered
              by smaller funds. The higher variability around returns is worth
              it to generate the highest absolute returns.

              If larger funds underperform smaller funds, why do they attract
              the most capital?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most capital invested in private real estate funds comes from
              institutional investors (pension plans, endowments, sovereign
              wealth funds) who often allocate between $100 million and $1
              billion per fund. These institutional investors usually have
              internal governors preventing them from being less than 40% of the
              capital in any one fund. This means they are not even able to
              consider most funds that are smaller than $500 million. This is
              one primary reason why large funds attract more capital than
              smaller funds – big begets big.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, it is more convenient to invest in larger funds than
              smaller funds. It takes more work to conduct due diligence on a
              smaller fund manager because their track records are usually more
              limited than larger fund managers. Often, the institutional
              investment teams do not view the extra work to be worth it. After
              all, no one gets fired for recommending an investment in a large,
              trusted fund that other institutions are investing in as well.
            </p>
            <h3>The advantage for private investors.</h3>
            <p>
              Private investors do not have rules preventing them from investing
              in certain funds. Because of this, they have a much larger
              investment universe. After all, there are hundreds of small funds
              in the United States and only a small handful of large funds.
            </p>
            <p>
              And private investors do not have to worry about losing their job
              for making a less “safe” investment decision. Private investors
              can take calculated risks to grow their own wealth instead of just
              investing in what is most convenient.
            </p>
            <h3>How can Uncommon Capital help?</h3>
            <p>
              We realize it is difficult for private investors to access
              differentiated, smaller funds, let alone determine which ones are
              better than others. Our team of industry experts has worked at
              private real estate firms for nearly a decade. We have deep
              relationships with talented fund managers across the country,
              resulting in unrivaled access that we share with our community of
              private investors.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are also skilled at analyzing real estate offerings, allowing
              us to curate opportunities with strong risk-return profiles that
              are structured fairly and transparently for our community.

              Capital-raising and investor-relations pro
              <strong>Ben Harris</strong> has set up his own firm.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Uncommon Capital</strong> of Chicago opened in the past
              month, focusing on raising equity for commercial real estate
              shops. Its first two clients are <strong>CRG</strong>, a
              development arm of Chicago construction firm
              <strong>Clayco</strong> that focuses on industrial and
              multi-family development, and
              <strong>Farpoint Development</strong>, a Chicago shop that invests
              in mixed-use projects.
            </p>

            <p>
              While Harris is running his new firm independently, he will
              continue to fill the role of senior vice president at CRG, which
              he joined in February. He previously spent five years at
              <strong>Origin Investment</strong> of Chicago, where he built and
              led a capital-raising team and helped raise funds for investments
              in federal opportunity zones. He had a prior stint as an analyst
              at <strong>Starwood Retail Partners</strong> of Chicago.
            </p>

            <p>
              Uncommon Capital is an “affiliate partner” of
              <strong>Stonehaven</strong>, a technology-focused broker-dealer.
              Stonehaven, of New York, is active in hedge funds, private equity,
              venture capital and, increasingly, real estate. It has 20
              affiliate partners raising capital for 30 real estate mandates.
            </p>

            <p>
              Uncommon is the fourth real estate firm Stonehaven has added this
              year to its online platform, which it calls Nexus. The first three
              were <strong>EverSky Capital</strong> of Chicago,
              <strong>Nomos Group</strong> of Denver and
              <strong>Park Lane</strong> of Santa Monica, Calif.
            </p>

            <p>
              Stonehaven earns a share of affiliate firms’ revenue in exchange
              for access to its broker-dealer infrastructure, Nexus technology
              and its “collaborative ecosystem,” among other things. The firm
              has about 100 cross-marketing agreements where affiliate partners
              are collaborating to raise capital for each other’s mandates.
            </p>

            <p>
              The shop, which began as a capital-raising operation and evolved
              into a platform for marketing firms, was founded in 2001 by chief
              executive <strong>David Frank</strong>.
