              real estate opportunities traditionally reserved for institutional
              players to private wealth investors.

            <p>
              He started the company in 2020, well before market conditions
              sidelined many of those institutional players and opened the door
              for private capital to fill the gap. Now, he’s leveraging the
              latest advancements in technology to provide even greater value
              for his investors.

              “Real estate is an interesting industry,” Harris said. “It's been
              around for many, many decades, and even though technology has
              advanced, it hasn't really permeated its way into how the real
              estate industry has done things. I'm not talking about just buying
              and building deals, but really the entire ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
              “At Uncommon, we've become kind of borderline obsessed with
              artificial intelligence,” he added.

              Harris spoke to Bisnow about leveraging AI in commercial real
              estate, founding his company and forecasting the financial
              environment for the year ahead.

            <h3>
              Bisnow: How did Uncommon Capital Group get its start, and where
              did you see the need for this kind of platform in a lower-rate
              environment?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Ben Harris:</strong> I founded Uncommon Capital Group in
              2020 on the heels of two incredibly formative job experiences. The
              first one was at a subsidiary of
              <a
                href="https://www.bisnow.com/tags/starwood-capital-group"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Starwood Capital Group</a
              >. I was the sixth employee, and at the time, we had a strategy
              that wasn't yet funded. Fast forward two years and we went from
              six employees to over 200 employees, from zero in assets under
              management to over $7B in assets under management. It was this
              incredibly formative experience, all entirely funded by
              institutional investors.
            </p>

            <p>
              Then I moved to another Chicago-based firm,
              <a
                href="https://www.bisnow.com/tags/origin-investments"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >Origin Investments</a
              >, which at the time was a very emerging manager with ambitions to
              grow into a well-known brand. Two principals asked if I would
              start and lead the investor relations and business development
              team. At the time, I was 25 years old. I did not have
              institutional relationships. I also really didn't have many
              relationships with high-net-worth individuals, but I felt like I
              could have some success there. After five years, we raised
              hundreds of millions of dollars with that strategy, and I realized
              just how underserved high-net-worth individuals, family offices
              and wealth management firms were in the real estate private equity
              space. Either they weren't seeing anything at all, they were
              seeing a suboptimal deal at the country club or someone was
              bringing them something that was pretty picked over.
            </p>

            <p>
              I started Uncommon Capital Group in 2020 to change that. I really
              wanted to bring an institutional experience to private-wealth
              investors, and what that meant was curating a group of family
              offices, wealth management platforms and ultra-high-net-worth
              individuals and then curating select opportunities with that.
              We're really trying to redefine private real estate investing.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Bisnow: Are these opportunities curated in a particular asset
              class?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> Our primary focus is in middle-market,
              real estate private equity funds that are anywhere from $150M up
              to $500M. In terms of asset classes, we still like some of the
              main food groups, but we really like the niches. Historically,
              industrial has been our largest, most favorite asset class.
            </p>

            <p>
              But more recently, we've been working in industrial outdoor
              storage. Historically, we did some in multifamily, but more
              recently, we’ve been doing a lot more student housing. We've been
              focusing on the niches because we think those offer really strong
              risk-adjusted opportunities, especially in the middle markets.

            <h3>
              Bisnow: What excites you about building a company from the ground
              up?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> Real estate is an interesting industry.
              It's been around for many, many decades, and even though
              technology has advanced, it hasn't really permeated its way into
              how the real estate industry has done things. I'm not talking
              about just buying and building deals, but really the entire
              ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
              At Uncommon, we've become kind of borderline obsessed with
              artificial intelligence. I was an early adopter, using it more in
              my personal life, but pretty quickly realizing just how powerful
              it can be for businesses today. With the pace of innovation, I
              realized just how powerful it will be in several months. I can't
              even imagine what it will look like in a few years.
            </p>

            <p>
              We mapped out all of our processes and figured out where
              artificial intelligence could take something and make it faster
              and give us back some of our own time. For example, we actually
              have various custom GPTs for different tasks, and that's something
              that I was able to play with on a weekend, wake up on a Monday and
              do it, because it's my business and we're entrepreneurial. It’s
              that part of the process that gets me really excited.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Bisnow: Does AI give you a bit of additional leverage to be able
              to punch above your weight when using some of these technologies,
              like these custom GPTs?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> Our mission is to help private investors
              do better in real estate investing. So with that always being our
              North Star, I know that I want to see as much as possible and be
              able to work through that funnel as thoroughly as possible so that
              what drops out of the bottom are the best-curated opportunities.
              That is a very time-consuming process. That’s why I just hired a
              vice president of investments to help oversee that process with
              me.
            </p>

            <p>
              But there's a lot that can be done with leveraging artificial
              intelligence. For example, we built a custom screener that we can
              just pop in a deck and it will automatically score it for us based
              on what we told it it cares about. We have seven table-stakes
              criteria that just have to be met for us to even take the initial
              call before we advance into diligence because that part of the
              process is very time-consuming. Sometimes, investors say, “How'd
              you meet with 400 groups last year?” That's because we can
              leverage technology to do it. We can actually figure out who's
              worthwhile spending time on pretty quickly by leveraging
              technology.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Bisnow: How do your clients feel about the use of AI in your
              workflow?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> It's just an initial screener, and at the
              end of the day, it is not running the full diligence process. We
              are still leveraging our decades of experience and institutional
              expertise to really run a comprehensive, multimonth diligence
              process, but there are parts that artificial intelligence is
              helpful for. What we do when we meet with current clients to give
              them updates or meet with prospective clients, we pop open the
              screen, ask them to send us any deck and we pop it in. And in
              under five seconds, it's perfectly summarized for them. That's
              just the high-level screener.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, you can't trust everything that you read in a deck.
              Certainly, there's legal documents, you have to vet the strategy.
              That today all happens outside of our GPT, and that's the process
              that we run on behalf of our clients. That's really our huge
              value-add to them. But certainly they're impressed by the
              technology, and they understand we're in our earliest days of
              building it. They can see where it might be going, and it does
              help us stand out from the crowd. Not many groups are doing it,
              and we're not doing it for show. It's actually effective.

            <h3>Bisnow: What else do you utilize AI for?</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> Content. A huge part of our value-add is
              educating our clients. The family offices, the wealth management
              professionals, the ultra-high-net-worth individuals, they're
              highly sophisticated, but they're also nonindustry professionals
              to real estate specifically. So they're very curious and they're
              investing large amounts of money. They want to understand the
              inner workings. They aren’t investors who are just making
              surface-level decisions. We do a lot of content, not to just say
              “industrial is good,” but to actually explain the
              supply-and-demand fundamentals, market by market — what tenants
              are doing and getting into the guts of it. We do leverage
              artificial intelligence to really break down some of those
              industry reports.
            </p>

            <h3>
              Bisnow: How has company strategy evolved from when you started it
              in 2020 to the higher-for-longer environment that we've settled in
              to today?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> Uncommon has become even more selective.
              We still evaluate as many opportunities as we ever have, but
              instead of working on maybe four to six opportunities per year, it
              might be one to two per year. That's just what we find compelling.
              In this higher-rate environment, real estate broadly does not
              offer the same risk-adjusted returns that it used to, and less and
              less opportunities are interesting to us. We really refuse to
              lower our bar. It's just being ultra selective.
            </p>

            <p>
              We also have been spending even more time with our clients.
              Education is a very key part of what we do. I'm young, and I want
              to be doing this for the next 30 years, not the next three years.
              We are always taking a long-term mindset on relationship building.
              We're breaking down what investors are already investing in and
              how those investments are performing, what we're seeing generally
              in the market and what we think might come next. It's super
              worthwhile for me because it gets me out and gets a pulse on the
              marketplace. And I like people, so it's fun to spend time with
              them.

              Bisnow: How do you see the financing environment evolving
              throughout the rest of the year?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> I never pretend to have a crystal ball.
              I've worked for a lot of smart people over the years, and they
              always said that, and I agree. Every time I think I might have it
              figured out, something comes out of left field. If you're asking
              me to make a forecast, I think we'll probably have a bit of a slow
              year again.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's earlier in the year, and so things can certainly change.
              There's a lot of uncertainty with the new administration, but
              they're also just a month into being in office. So maybe we get
              some more answers and questions over the coming months.
            </p>

            <p>
              But regardless of that, with the 10-year Treasury back near
              all-time highs, it's really unclear what's going to change that
              anytime soon. It will have a continued cooling effect on the
              transaction market. Not that there aren’t interesting pockets of
              investment opportunities, but it's just not broad-based like it
              was in that late 2020, 2021 range. We might be signed up for
              another slower year.

              It's too early to tell. It's been about a month, and I think
              everybody is willing to see what happens over the next few months.
              In the meantime, I do think a lot of investors are taking a
              wait-and-see approach. They have the benefit of time. Nothing is
              forcing them to act today or tomorrow. If they have a few months

              American-based company, and it's highly accessible.

              Bisnow: What’s your weekend routine or favorite weekend activity?
            </h3>

            <p>
              <strong>Harris:</strong> For me, weekends are all about family
              time. I work a lot during the week and love to run around the city
              with my wife and my one-and-a-half-year-old daughter, checking out
              new restaurants, museums, parks when it's nice outside, and then
              certainly take advantage of the me time during nap times. I make
              it to the gym, I'll go golfing and I geek out way too often on
              playing around with ChatGPT.

              In 2013, Starwood Capital raised eyebrows when they went all in on
              a new investment strategy. That year the firm acquired 7 regional
              shopping malls for $1 billion. Over the next two years, they
              gobbled up another $6 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward – the esteemed firm has since defaulted on most of
              its loans and

                rel="noopener noreferrer"
                >lost control of its mall portfolio</a
              >.
            </p>
            <p>
              What went wrong? Starwood believed weakening mall performance
              created an opportunity to buy assets at a discount in what was
              still a core property sector at the time. However, they
              underestimated the trend of e-commerce. In 2013, online sales were
              still less than 10% of total retail sales and Amazon’s market cap
              was only $125 billion (vs. ~25%<sup>1</sup> and ~$1.9 trillion
              today).
            </p>

            <p>
              How do I know all of this? Because I worked at Starwood as a young
              financial analyst while the firm went on its buying spree.
            </p>

            <p>
              It was an important lesson to learn early in my career. Never
              underestimate a technological trend and its potential impact on
              physical space (aka real estate).
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, that technological trend is artificial intelligence. As an
              avid daily user of AI, I believe its future impact should be taken
              seriously by all real estate investors.
            </p>

            <h2>What is AI?</h2>
            <p>
              Most of us really only became familiar with AI in November 2022
              when ChatGPT was first released to the public. Immediately, people
              were awed by the text and image generation capabilities (fyi - I
              used DALL·E to make the futuristic image for this post in less
              than 10 seconds).
            </p>
            <p>
              But AI is more than just Siri on steroids. As an engine that can
              “learn” when fed reams of data and information, AI is already
              being “trained” in specific and complicated disciplines, like law
              and medicine. It doesn’t just answer email using your tone and
              humor. It can write legal briefs citing case law that would have
              taken hours for lawyers to dig up. Even mental health
              professionals are starting to use AI to diagnose and counsel
              people in crisis.

            <h2>Which real estate sectors will be impacted the most?</h2>
            <p>
              Here are the winners and losers that I expect will come into focus
              in the years ahead.
            </p>
            <h3>Winners</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Centers:</strong> The clear beneficiary as AI
                demands more and more computational power and storage. This was
                already a healthy sector, but is expected to have sustained
                growth as AI gains widespread adoption.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Industrial:</strong> If AI speeds e-commerce and
                increases profitability, demand for warehouses should continue
                to grow.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Life Sciences:</strong> Many believe AI will supercharge
                the development of new drugs and other discoveries. This trend
                is likely to increase demand for lab and production space.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Losers</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Office:</strong> The most obvious casualty of AI.
                Already the new technology is replacing jobs and is likely to
                continue doing so. Demand for office space is naturally going to
                weaken.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retail:</strong> E-commerce had already been growing,
                and any efficiencies it generates will only further fuel that.
                Unfortunately, that likely means more bad news for overall
                retail space demand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multifamily:</strong> This one is more controversial,
                but Cohen & Steers has theorized “displacement of jobs could
                lead to lower employment and reduce wage growth”<sup>2</sup>. I
                worry about this as well. If this happens, who will rent all the
                high-end apartments across the country?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bottom line</h2>
            <p>
              Anyone who has toyed around with AI, or perhaps even implemented
              it into everyday life, knows it’s the real deal. And ChatGPT only
              launched less than a year and half ago.

              <strong>CHICAGO (January 31st, 2025)</strong> –
              <a href="https://www.investuncommon.com/"
                >Uncommon Capital Group</a
              >, a market-leading real estate investment firm serving private
              wealth clients across the United States, today announced the
              appointment of Danny Dlugie as vice president to further
              strengthen the firm’s institutional-grade expertise in sourcing
              and evaluating opportunities for its private investor community.
              Dlugie comes to Uncommon with significant experience from GCM
              Grosvenor, where he sourced private offerings and executed
              investments for the executed investments for the $80 billion asset
              manager serving a diverse institutional client base that included
              pension funds, endowments and sovereign wealth funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Founded in 2020 by Ben Harris, Uncommon Capital Group is a premier
              real estate investment platform that connects an exclusive
              community of family offices, registered investment advisors and
              high-net-worth individuals with top-tier real estate managers
              across the United States, granting access to highly curated real
              estate opportunities previously unavailable to private investors.
              With a client base representing tens of billions of dollars in
              investable assets, Uncommon has successfully helped its private
              investors allocate over $800 million of equity in
              difficult-to-access offerings, funding $2.5 billion in
              transactions across 28 U.S. markets.
            </p>

            <p>
              Recent investments reflect a commitment to opportunities with
              attractive risk-reward potential and transparent, equitable fee
              structures. These include $270.2 million in a proprietary
              industrial fund with national developer
              <a href="https://www.realcrg.com/" target="_blank">CRG</a>; $76.3
              million in an exclusive GP fund targeting Class A industrial,
              multifamily and student housing investments; and $19.4 million in
              a private co-investment with a top developer.
            </p>

            <p>
              The rapid growth of family offices, registered investment advisors
              and high-net-worth individuals in real estate is transforming the
              industry, with private capital now surpassing institutional
              investors as the largest source of funding. Over the past decade,
              private investment in commercial real estate has surged, reaching
              $338 billion in 2023, with private buyers and high-net-worth
              individuals emerging as the most active participants, according to
              <a
                href="https://www.knightfrank.com/research/article/2024-03-05-navigating-the-recovery"
                target="_blank"
                >Knight Frank</a
              >. Despite this growth, private investors have historically lacked
              access to the premier real estate opportunities traditionally
              reserved for institutional capital.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Adding Danny to our leadership team marks a pivotal moment for
              our firm,” said Ben Harris, founder and chief executive officer of
              Uncommon Capital Group. “His institutional experience, analytical
              rigor and deep understanding of the private markets will
              immediately enhance our investment sourcing and diligence
              capabilities, positioning us to deliver even greater value to our
              community.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Dlugie’s addition will further empower the firm to source even
              more highly curated investment opportunities uniquely positioned
              to pursue strong, risk-adjusted returns for its private wealth
              clients. Specifically, Uncommon is focused on middle-market funds
              that offer access to underserved niches with significant growth
              potential relative to the megafunds that are more widely available
              to investors.
            </p>

            <p>
              “We’re committed to speaking with every middle-market real estate
              private equity firm across the country, ensuring we’re at the
              forefront of market opportunities and can offer our community
              unparalleled access to premium deals and funds,” Harris added.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prior to joining Uncommon, Dlugie brought valuable experience from
              his role in the Private Equity Investments group at GCM Grosvenor,
              where he screened and conducted due diligence on private equity
              funds, identifying premier investment opportunities for large
              institutional clients. He actively participated in executing
              investments, monitoring fund performance and preparing detailed
              client reports. Dlugie also previously served as an investment
              professional at Lightbank, a Chicago-based venture capital firm.
            </p>

            <p>
              “Over the past few years, I have followed Ben’s mission at
              Uncommon to redefine real estate investing for private investors,
              and I am amazed by what he has accomplished so far,” said Dlugie.
              “I look forward to leveraging my expertise to drive growth,
              enhance our offerings and continue delivering a best-in-class
              investor experience that solidifies Uncommon as a leader in this
              fast-growing and essential segment of the real estate investment
              market.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Dlugie has a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of
              Texas at Austin and recently earned an MBA from the University of
              Chicago Booth School of Business.
