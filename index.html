              For the past decade, the same real estate fund managers have been
              sucking up the majority of investor capital into their mega funds.
              In fact, only a quarter of total capital raised in recent years
              has gone to smaller managers (Preqin Global Real Estate Report,
              2021).
            </p>
            <p>
              But why? Are larger funds better or are they simply more
              convenient to invest in? In 2017, Preqin, the premier database for
              private real estate, conducted a comprehensive study to help
              answer this question.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the report, smaller funds (less than $500 million)
              consistently outperform their larger counterparts. From 2005 to
              2014, small funds generated a median return of 10.9%, while
              mid-sized funds ($500 – 999 million) generated 9.1% and larger
              funds ($1 billion or more) earned 6.9%. This study proves that
              larger size is not necessarily correlated with larger profits, and
              investors should be taking a closer look.

            <h3>How do the top and bottom performers compare?</h3>
            <p>
              Smaller funds in the top quartile generated a median net IRR of
              15.8%, outperforming the 12.4% and 12.0% median net IRRs produced
              by mid-sized and large funds, respectively. No one year buoyed the
              overall median net returns either. Top quartile small funds
              outperformed top quartile larger funds in 8 of the 10 vintages
              examined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even the worst of the smaller funds outperformed the worst of the
              larger funds. Smaller funds in the bottom quartile earned a medium
              net IRR of 6.2%, beating the 2.8% return generated by both
              mid-sized and larger bottom quartile funds.
            </p>
            <h3>Do smaller funds mean more risk?</h3>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, yes. Smaller funds are more volatile than
              larger funds. While these funds typically demonstrate higher net
              IRRs than larger funds, the returns typically have a higher
              standard deviation around them.
            </p>
            <h3>Is the risk worth the reward?</h3>
            <p>
              According to Preqin data, the best risk/return profile is offered
              by smaller funds. The higher variability around returns is worth
              it to generate the highest absolute returns.

            <h3>
              If larger funds underperform smaller funds, why do they attract
              the most capital?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most capital invested in private real estate funds comes from
              institutional investors (pension plans, endowments, sovereign
              wealth funds) who often allocate between $100 million and $1
              billion per fund. These institutional investors usually have
              internal governors preventing them from being less than 40% of the
              capital in any one fund. This means they are not even able to
              consider most funds that are smaller than $500 million. This is
              one primary reason why large funds attract more capital than
              smaller funds – big begets big.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, it is more convenient to invest in larger funds than
              smaller funds. It takes more work to conduct due diligence on a
              smaller fund manager because their track records are usually more
              limited than larger fund managers. Often, the institutional
              investment teams do not view the extra work to be worth it. After
              all, no one gets fired for recommending an investment in a large,
              trusted fund that other institutions are investing in as well.
            </p>
            <h3>The advantage for private investors.</h3>
            <p>
              Private investors do not have rules preventing them from investing
              in certain funds. Because of this, they have a much larger
              investment universe. After all, there are hundreds of small funds
              in the United States and only a small handful of large funds.
            </p>
            <p>
              And private investors do not have to worry about losing their job
              for making a less “safe” investment decision. Private investors
              can take calculated risks to grow their own wealth instead of just
              investing in what is most convenient.
            </p>

              In 2013, Starwood Capital raised eyebrows when they went all in on
              a new investment strategy. That year the firm acquired 7 regional
              shopping malls for $1 billion. Over the next two years, they
              gobbled up another $6 billion.

            <p>
              What went wrong? Starwood believed weakening mall performance
              created an opportunity to buy assets at a discount in what was
              still a core property sector at the time. However, they
              underestimated the trend of e-commerce. In 2013, online sales were
              still less than 10% of total retail sales and Amazon’s market cap
              was only $125 billion (vs. ~25%<sup>1</sup> and ~$1.9 trillion
              today).
            </p>

            <p>
              How do I know all of this? Because I worked at Starwood as a young
              financial analyst while the firm went on its buying spree.

              It was an important lesson to learn early in my career. Never
              underestimate a technological trend and its potential impact on
              physical space (aka real estate).
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, that technological trend is artificial intelligence. As an
              avid daily user of AI, I believe its future impact should be taken
              seriously by all real estate investors.
            </p>

            <h2>What is AI?</h2>
            <p>
              Most of us really only became familiar with AI in November 2022
              when ChatGPT was first released to the public. Immediately, people
              were awed by the text and image generation capabilities (fyi - I
              used DALL·E to make the futuristic image for this post in less
              than 10 seconds).
            </p>
            <p>
              But AI is more than just Siri on steroids. As an engine that can
              “learn” when fed reams of data and information, AI is already
              being “trained” in specific and complicated disciplines, like law
              and medicine. It doesn’t just answer email using your tone and
              humor. It can write legal briefs citing case law that would have
              taken hours for lawyers to dig up. Even mental health
              professionals are starting to use AI to diagnose and counsel
              people in crisis.

              And the companies leading the growth of AI see massive expansion.

            <h2>Which real estate sectors will be impacted the most?</h2>
            <p>
              Here are the winners and losers that I expect will come into focus
              in the years ahead.
            </p>
            <h3>Winners</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Data Centers:</strong> The clear beneficiary as AI
                demands more and more computational power and storage. This was
                already a healthy sector, but is expected to have sustained
                growth as AI gains widespread adoption.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Industrial:</strong> If AI speeds e-commerce and
                increases profitability, demand for warehouses should continue
                to grow.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Life Sciences:</strong> Many believe AI will supercharge
                the development of new drugs and other discoveries. This trend
                is likely to increase demand for lab and production space.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Losers</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Office:</strong> The most obvious casualty of AI.
                Already the new technology is replacing jobs and is likely to
                continue doing so. Demand for office space is naturally going to
                weaken.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Retail:</strong> E-commerce had already been growing,
                and any efficiencies it generates will only further fuel that.
                Unfortunately, that likely means more bad news for overall
                retail space demand.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Multifamily:</strong> This one is more controversial,
                but Cohen & Steers has theorized “displacement of jobs could
                lead to lower employment and reduce wage growth”<sup>2</sup>. I
                worry about this as well. If this happens, who will rent all the
                high-end apartments across the country?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Bottom line</h2>
            <p>
              Anyone who has toyed around with AI, or perhaps even implemented
              it into everyday life, knows it’s the real deal. And ChatGPT only
              launched less than a year and half ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the next few years, stories like the ones about Klarna and
              Tyler Perry will be the norm, not the exception. That’s why it’s
              so important to future-proof your new real estate allocations now,
              as your investments will undoubtedly be impacted by the rapid
              adoption of AI.

            <p>
              To state the obvious, industrial leasing has slowed. And in some
              corners of the market, leasing basically ground to a halt over the
              past year. Yes, it’s true the industrial sector has been faring
              much better than other property types. After all, 2023 was yet
              another year of double-digit national rent growth. But the asset
              class certainly hasn’t been immune to macroeconomic headwinds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why has leasing slowed? And is it time for investors to panic? Not
              quite – here’s why.
            </p>

            <h2>What happened?</h2>
            <p>
              On the back of e-commerce, industrial leasing experienced
              unimpeded growth for over a decade, and reached a crescendo during
              the pandemic. The recent annual leasing totals from a new CBRE
              report<sup>1</sup> are pretty astounding:
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong
                >2019: 560 million SF; 2020: 720M SF; 2021: 1 billion SF</strong
              >
            </p>

            <p>
              Woah, that escalated quickly. After a then-record year in 2019,
              leasing activity nearly doubled only two short years later. This
              dynamic, of course, encouraged developers to build a record number
              of new buildings. However, demand still overwhelmed new supply,
              and national vacancy rates continued to hover around a remarkably
              low 3%.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now, let’s fast forward. In 2022, leasing “dropped” to 865 million
              SF before declining further to 790 million SF in 2023. How come?
              Because tenants became cautious about making major capital
              investments, such as opening new logistics facilities, while faced
              with rising financing costs and economic uncertainties, per Green
              Street<sup>2</sup>. Weaker demand was especially pronounced among
              big box users. Industrial sector pros have been calling the trend
              of recent lower leasing levels “a return to normal” relative
              pre-pandemic years.
            </p>

            <p>The issue though is while leasing has cooled, supply has not.</p>

            <p>
              Another 156.3 million SF of industrial facilities were completed
              in Q4 2023. That’s the second highest quarterly total on record
              (only behind the 173.2 million SF delivered in the previous
              quarter), according to Cushman & Wakefield<sup>3</sup>. While
              tenants can wake up one morning and decide they want to hold off
              on making a lease decision, developers don’t have this luxury.
              They need to finish what they started, which is why new projects
              that broke ground in the first half of 2023 are still being
              delivered, even though tenant demand has paused.
            </p>

            <p>
              This has caused the national vacancy rate to creep up to 5.2%, up
              from the boom-market lows but still below the 10-year pre-pandemic
              historical average.
            </p>

            <h2>What happens next?</h2>

            <p>
              The market needs to digest more new supply over the first half of
              2024. That means vacancy rates will likely tick higher. However,
              in the second half of the year, new deliveries will drop off a
              cliff. CBRE points out new construction starts have declined for
              five straight quarters due to market uncertainty and a difficult
              lending environment.

            <p>
              As for tenant demand, macroeconomics will determine what happens
              next. If inflation continues to stay low, the Fed cuts interest
              rates, and consumer demand stays strong, then tenants are expected
              to jump off the sidelines. If inflation ends up being sticky,
              interest rates stay high, and consumer demand weakens, then it
              could be another slow year for industrial leasing activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              In 2025 and beyond though, Cushman & Wakefield and CBRE both agree
              most Tier 1 industrial markets are expected to be undersupplied.
              The historical growth engines for the sector still remain –
              ecommerce growth and supply chain resiliency.
            </p>

            <p>
              CBRE says e-commerce still only accounts for 23% of non-auto or
              gas related retail sales and is expected to grow to 26% in the
              next few years and 34% in 10 years. More goods sold online will
              result in more demand for industrial space to deliver goods to
              consumers at increasingly faster speeds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Separately, companies are embracing onshoring and nearshoring
              after the pandemic shined a light on significant vulnerabilities
              in our nation’s supply chains. Other recent supply chain issues
              include the Suez Canal obstruction, Russia-Ukraine War, Panama
              Canal drought, Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, and others.
            </p>

            <p>
              Helping matters, the U.S. government has bolstered supply chain
              resiliency by pouring tens of billions of dollars into the cause
              through the Inflation Reduction and CHIPS acts. This will
              undoubtedly have significant positive upstream and downstream
              impacts on demand for industrial real estate.
            </p>

            <h2>Bottom line</h2>

            <p>
              Yes, industrial leasing has been taking a temporary breather. But
              it’s a matter of “when”, not “if” tenants will start signing more
              leases at new, modern buildings. E-commerce, onshoring and
              nearshoring will make sure of that.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the meantime, investment in the sector will favor a nuanced
              approach. Smaller assets will be attractive, plus larger deals in
              select, underserved markets.
