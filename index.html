                Uncommon Capital Group was founded by Ben Harris to deliver
                premium investment access, due diligence, and service to a
                premier community of private investors. Ben began his career at
                Starwood Capital, one of the largest real estate private equity
                firms in the world, where he conducted investment analysis and
                reporting for the company and its sovereign wealth fund
                investors. Ben then joined Origin Investments as one of the
                first employees where he started and led the investor relations
                and business development team. Under his leadership, the firm
                became one of the nation’s preeminent direct-to-investor
                platforms with thousands of private investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Uncommon Capital Group was born out of these experiences and the
                belief that private investors deserve an institutional
                experience at every step of the investment process. Harnessing
                more than a decade of industry expertise, we offer a

              For the past decade, the same real estate fund managers have been
              sucking up the majority of investor capital into their mega funds.
              In fact, only a quarter of total capital raised in recent years
              has gone to smaller managers (Preqin Global Real Estate Report,
              2021).
            </p>
            <p>
              But why? Are larger funds better or are they simply more
              convenient to invest in? In 2017, Preqin, the premier database for
              private real estate, conducted a comprehensive study to help
              answer this question.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to the report, smaller funds (less than $500 million)
              consistently outperform their larger counterparts. From 2005 to
              2014, small funds generated a median return of 10.9%, while
              mid-sized funds ($500 – 999 million) generated 9.1% and larger
              funds ($1 billion or more) earned 6.9%. This study proves that
              larger size is not necessarily correlated with larger profits, and
              investors should be taking a closer look.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="story_second_section">
            <h3>How do the top and bottom performers compare?</h3>
            <p>
              Smaller funds in the top quartile generated a median net IRR of
              15.8%, outperforming the 12.4% and 12.0% median net IRRs produced
              by mid-sized and large funds, respectively. No one year buoyed the
              overall median net returns either. Top quartile small funds
              outperformed top quartile larger funds in 8 of the 10 vintages
              examined.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even the worst of the smaller funds outperformed the worst of the
              larger funds. Smaller funds in the bottom quartile earned a medium
              net IRR of 6.2%, beating the 2.8% return generated by both
              mid-sized and larger bottom quartile funds.
            </p>
            <h3>Do smaller funds mean more risk?</h3>
            <p>
              Generally speaking, yes. Smaller funds are more volatile than
              larger funds. While these funds typically demonstrate higher net
              IRRs than larger funds, the returns typically have a higher
              standard deviation around them.
            </p>
            <h3>Is the risk worth the reward?</h3>
            <p>
              According to Preqin data, the best risk/return profile is offered
              by smaller funds. The higher variability around returns is worth
              it to generate the highest absolute returns.

              If larger funds underperform smaller funds, why do they attract
              the most capital?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Most capital invested in private real estate funds comes from
              institutional investors (pension plans, endowments, sovereign
              wealth funds) who often allocate between $100 million and $1
              billion per fund. These institutional investors usually have
              internal governors preventing them from being less than 40% of the
              capital in any one fund. This means they are not even able to
              consider most funds that are smaller than $500 million. This is
              one primary reason why large funds attract more capital than
              smaller funds – big begets big.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, it is more convenient to invest in larger funds than
              smaller funds. It takes more work to conduct due diligence on a
              smaller fund manager because their track records are usually more
              limited than larger fund managers. Often, the institutional
              investment teams do not view the extra work to be worth it. After
              all, no one gets fired for recommending an investment in a large,
              trusted fund that other institutions are investing in as well.
            </p>
            <h3>The advantage for private investors.</h3>
            <p>
              Private investors do not have rules preventing them from investing
              in certain funds. Because of this, they have a much larger
              investment universe. After all, there are hundreds of small funds
              in the United States and only a small handful of large funds.
            </p>
            <p>
              And private investors do not have to worry about losing their job
              for making a less “safe” investment decision. Private investors
              can take calculated risks to grow their own wealth instead of just
              investing in what is most convenient.
            </p>
            <h3>How can Uncommon Capital Group help?</h3>
            <p>
              We realize it is difficult for private investors to access
              differentiated, smaller funds, let alone determine which ones are
              better than others. Our team of industry experts has worked at
              private real estate firms for nearly a decade. We have deep
              relationships with talented fund managers across the country,
              resulting in unrivaled access that we share with our community of
              private investors.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are also skilled at analyzing real estate offerings, allowing
              us to curate opportunities with strong risk-return profiles that
              are structured fairly and transparently for our community.

              After years in the making, private investors have officially

              commercial real estate for the first time on record, according to

            <h3>What caused this shift?</h3>
            <p>
              In recent years, top investment managers have been trying to
              diversify their sources of capital, like how businesses aim to
              diversify their sources of revenue. This strategy has led to new
              opportunities for private investors and has enabled them to play a
              more substantial role in the private real estate market.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another factor contributing to this change is technological
              advancements have made it easier to manage large investor bases.
              This has led to increased adoption from leading managers who were
              previously concerned about the administrative burden of having so
              many investors.
            </p>

            <h3>By the numbers</h3>
            <p>
              Over the last decade, private capital invested per year has grown
              from $187.7 billion in 2013 to $454.8 billion in 2022 - an
              incredible 142% jump in the last decade.
            </p>
            <p>
              What could the next decade look like? Applying the prior 10-year
              average growth rate of 10.3%, total private capital invested per
              year could grow to $1.2 trillion by 2032. This would dwarf
              institutional capital, which has historically grown at a much
              slower rate.
            </p>

            <h3>Bottom line</h3>
            <p>
              With more investment opportunities available from better
              investment managers, individuals, family offices, and RIAs can
              expect to participate in funds and deals that were previously
              inaccessible. As we move forward, it will be interesting to see
              how this shift continues to reshape the investment landscape.
            </p>
            <p>
              One thing is for sure though – not all investment opportunities
              are created equal. At Uncommon Capital Group, we help our private
              community navigate the complicated investment universe by curating
              opportunities with strong risk-return profiles from leading real
              estate managers.

              have caused concern among investors, leading them to ask fair
              questions about their own investments. Industrial real estate is
              one of the largest holdings in both portfolios, bringing extra
              attention to the asset class.

              While industrial has been the best performing property type over
              the last 10 years, some investors worry that what goes up must
              come down. What’s actually next for the sector? Recently published
              industry data is starting to provide clues about
              <strong>rent growth</strong> and <strong>cap rates</strong>, two
              of the most important metrics that determine future investment
              performance.

              Rents continue to hit new all-time highs, according to a recent
              CBRE report. The report highlights how a record-low national
              vacancy rate of 2.9% has created heightened competition for
              limited available space, driving rents increasingly higher.

            <h3>What’s happening today?</h3>

              well.

              According to Green Street data, industrial cap rates steadily
              declined for more than a decade before bottoming out in Q4 2021 at
              3.7%. Since then, cap rates have increased to 4.6% to adjust to
              higher debt costs, causing property values to decrease.

            <h3>What's next?</h3>
            <p>
              Cap rates are expected to continue to move with interest rates, so
              the Fed will dictate what happens next. That being said, there is
              reason to be optimistic that cap rates may only increase
              incrementally without rocketing higher.
            </p>
            <p>
              According to Newmark’s report, there are record levels of capital
              on the sidelines waiting to be deployed, which will keep cap rates
              in check and help buoy real estate valuations. In 2021 and through
              three quarters of 2022, an estimated $1 billion has been raised
              for investment in real estate.

              Newmark’s report predicts a lot of the “dry powder” is expected to
              be allocated to industrial real estate because investors continue
              to be excited about the long-term tailwinds of the sector.

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>
              Rents and cap rates are both up from earlier this year, creating
              an offsetting effect on investment returns. What happens next will
              be largely dependent on how high the Fed hikes rates. While it may
              be tempting to want to regularly track the pricing of private real
              estate investments, it’s important to remember one of the main
              benefits of the illiquid, longer-term asset class is its lack of
              volatility relative to the whipsawing stock market. Embrace the
              stability and let the sector tailwinds play out.
